                    The people of Lutheran Church of the Resurrection are people just like you. We have in common our hopes and dreams for lives that matter, for hope and joy, for comfort and healing, all of which we have found in the good news God has given us in Jesus.

                    Our current worship styles vary to include traditional, contemporary, new liturgies, contemplative, alternative language and forms of music.<br /><br />

                    <b>Children are always welcome at every service.</b> There is a time just for children before the sermon. <br /><br />
                    <b>We celebrate Holy Communion at every service</b>, the meal which Jesus gave his first followers. We believe Jesus is still with us as we celebrate that meal, inviting us to know peace, forgiveness, joy, hope and new life. You are invited to come to the meal with us. Little children are welcome to come forward to receive a blessing. <br /><br />

                    Whether you come to the meal or not, you are welcome to take full part in the worship service with us. Both services are printed in a bulletin and is easy to follow, so you donâ€™t need to worry about what to do and when.<br /><br />

                    We hope to see you at Lutheran Church of the Resurrection, as together we give all praise and adoration to our Lord.
