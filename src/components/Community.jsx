                                    The Wimberley Valley Habitat for Humanity was established in 1992 as a locally run affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International, a nonprofit, ecumenical Christian housing organization. Habitat for Humanity works in partnership with people in need to build decent, affordable housing. This is accomplished through various partnerships with volunteer workers, generous donors, prayer partners, and the homeowner/partners who are required to work building their house. The houses are sold to those in need at no profit and with no interest charge.

                                    <b>Make a difference:  Adopt-a-Highway!</b>
                                    The Adopt-a-Highway program of the Texas Department of Transportation gives you an　opportunity to keep Texas beautiful.
                
                                    The Adopt-a-Highway program began in Texas in 1985 and continues to grow, saving taxpayer’s money and keeping our rights-of-way clean. Following Texas’ lead, other states have created an Adopt-a-Highway program, and officials from Great Britain, Japan, and South Africa have visited Texas to learn more about starting programs of their own. This Texas-born program has spread to 49 states, Canada, Great Britain, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, and Mexico. More than 1.3 million volunteers participate in Adopt-a-Highway nationwide.
